    <p>Partizans story is very unik in every way. Partizan is a basketball club from Belgrade, Serbia. During the civil war in the Yugoslavia in the beginning of 90s Serbian clubs were 
        not allowed to play in their home country. Partizan, regular competitor in the highest europian basketball league, the Euro League, had to find new home.
    </p>
    
    <p>Leading board of the club had to make decision on where to play their home-games. After the long meeting Partizans CEO with new couch Zelimir Obradovic, who was Partizans player just
        year piror, decided on small town just outside of Madrid. 
    </p>
    <p>While Partizan did not expect much from this season couch Zeljko insisted on players making friends with locals so to win their support. Dispite the odds thay managed to win the 
        hearts of locals and people started filling the arenas when there was a game. Even when "Steamroller", as nicknamed by fans, meet spanish clubs so were Fuenlabradas rezidents loyal
        to them. Suddenly Partizan became the main attraction, since there was war in Yugoslavia, merch was hard to find, so fans started making own. Taping latters on the t-shirts, 
        painting partiznas logo, even just wearing black all to show support to a team form not just another country, but from completly other culture.
